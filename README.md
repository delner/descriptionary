# Descriptionary

It's Pictionary + Telephone!

### Introduction

Descriptionary combines pictionary and telephone into a game where users take turns drawing and guessing each others pictures.

* The game begins with a phrase; the first user must draw a picture.
* Each subsequent user either guesses what the word was from a picture, or draws a picture from the last user's guess.
* The game ends when all users have taken their turn; then all can see what was lost in translation!

### Notes

This game was produced in Fall 2010 for an external client, as a sponsored college senior project within a Design Seminar course. The game utilizes vanilla PHP, Javascript, and some Flash/ActionScript. It acts as an extension to the client's website, and is missing some libraries... unfortunately this code cannot run standalone (sorry!), but feel free to browse through!
